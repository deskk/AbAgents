Planner Agent: Creates and adjusts plans based on objectives and feedback.
Coder Agent: Generates code to execute tasks such as data retrieval and model execution.
Critic Agent: Reviews plans and code for accuracy and efficacy.
Assistant Agent: Executes functions and integrates outputs from various models.
Deep Learning Models:

Antibody Design Model: Generates initial antibody sequences targeting specific antigens.
Optimization Model: Refines antibody sequences to enhance desired properties.
Analysis Model: Predicts properties to assess candidate viability.
RAG with llama_index:

Integrates domain-specific knowledge into the LLM framework for informed decision-making.

Role of Structure Prediction, Molecular Simulation, and Docking in Antibody Drug Discovery
a. Structure Prediction (e.g., AlphaFold)
Purpose:

3D Structure Determination: Predicts the three-dimensional structure of antibody sequences.
Understanding Binding Sites: Helps identify the antigen-binding regions and potential conformational changes.
Guiding Optimization: Provides structural insights that can inform sequence modifications to improve binding affinity and specificity.
b. Molecular Simulation
Purpose:

Dynamic Behavior Analysis: Simulates the movement and flexibility of antibodies and antigens over time.
Stability Assessment: Evaluates the thermal and structural stability of antibody candidates.
Interaction Insights: Provides detailed information on intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts.
c. Docking Simulation
Purpose:

Predicting Binding Modes: Estimates how an antibody binds to its target antigen.
Affinity Estimation: Assesses the strength of the antibody-antigen interaction.
Identifying Key Residues: Highlights critical amino acids involved in binding, which can be targets for optimization.
