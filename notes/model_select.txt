optimization & analysis deep learning model selection criteria:

Compatibility with Antibody Sequences:

The model must accept antibody sequences as input and be capable of processing variable regions specific to antibodies.
Predictive Accuracy:

Models should have a proven track record with high accuracy in predicting or optimizing the desired properties.
Integration Ease:

Should be implementable within your existing Python-based framework and callable from agent_functions.py.
Open Source or Accessible APIs:

Prefer models that are open-source or have well-documented APIs for integration.
Computational Efficiency:

Models should run efficiently on available hardware (CPU/GPU) without requiring excessive computational resources.
Active Community and Support:

Models with active development communities can provide support and updates, ensuring longevity and reliability.
Documentation and Usability:

Comprehensive documentation aids in smoother integration and troubleshooting.
