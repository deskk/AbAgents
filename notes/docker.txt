1. write Dockerfile
2. Build the Docker Image
In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run:

docker build -t antibody_app .

Explanation:

docker build: Command to build a Docker image.

-t antibody_app: Tags the image with the name antibody_app.

.: Specifies the build context (current directory).

3. Run the Docker Container
You'll need to pass the OpenAI API key to the container as an environment variable.

docker run -it --rm \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key \
  antibody_app

Explanation:

-it: Runs the container in interactive mode with a TTY.

--rm: Automatically removes the container when it exits.

-e OPENAI_API_KEY=...: Sets the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable inside the container.

antibody_app: The name of the image to run.

Mounting Volumes (Optional)
If you want to access or persist data outside the container:

docker run -it --rm \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  antibody_app

-v $(pwd)/data:/app/data: Mounts the data directory from your host into the container.

4. Test and Debug
When the container runs, your application should start and prompt for user input.

Enter your antibody design request as usual.

Debugging Inside the Container
If you encounter issues, you can start a shell inside the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  antibody_app
This allows you to:

Inspect files and directories.

Run Python scripts manually.

Install additional packages if needed.
